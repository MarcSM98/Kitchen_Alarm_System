## Components
- Buzzer
- LED Indicator
- Motion Sensor
- Fire Sensor
- LCD Display
- DIP Switch
- Arduino UNO


## Technologies Used:
- C++


## Circuit Boards
- Transistor Circuit: The RGB LED control circuit uses a transistor to allow 12V to flow through the LED when the Arduino pin powers the base, enabling current flow from collector to emitter to ground.
